<h3>Spanning columns</h3>

<div class="example">
  <section>
    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</p>
    <h2 class="example-1">Spanning subhead</h2>
    <p>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>
    <p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
